# FirstRepo
The main objective of this project is to create a website that shows up-to-date information about certain Football (Soccer) leagues and to provide statistics and information about the teams participating in the competition along with the respective league. 

We are using free REST API to fetch all the data (Football-data.org)

This is ASP.NET 5, MVC 6 based single page application :) and we have used Angular JS on the client side.

We would like to improve on this project and show score simulation of specific fixtures, to show what the outcome might be for that fixture. This is planned as a future enhancement.

Please feel free to contribute to this project.
