# FirstRepo
The main objective of this project is to create a website that shows up-to-date information about certain Football leagues, 
and to provide statictics and information about the teams participating in the competition along with the league itself . 

We are getting our information from an free online rest api (Football-data.org)

This is an MVC application, and Angular JS is used for coding the front end.

We would like to improve on this project and show score simulation of specific fixtures, to show what the outcome might be for that fixture
This is a future project.
